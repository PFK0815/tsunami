# tsunami
This is a minetest mod.<br />

Want a tsunami in your game? Here you can get it!<br />
In creative inventory you have a `tsunami:source` block available.<br />
Use `/anti_tsunami <radius>` to delete tsunami blocks, limit 500.<br />
Information: It has one source block and no flowing state, as flowing block it sets a source which sets again sources. So you could get many, many, ... many, sources of it.<br />
To delete sources use `/anti_tsunami`. More for the command on top.
